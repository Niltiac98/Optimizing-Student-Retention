# Optimizing Student Retention
This project analyzes anonymized swim school data to identify the best timing for additional student help and parent communication. By implementing these strategies, the school reduced year-over-year withdrawals due to lack of progress by 50%, showcasing effective retention and satisfaction improvements.

## 1. Problem Identification:

### Step 1: Analyzed the reasons for student withdrawals.

On our withdrawal forms, we have a space where the parent can write the reason for withdrawal, and a scale of 1-10 for rating our facility.

### Step 2: Focused on factors that could be influenced by the swim school.

For the purpose of this analysis, I limited the factors to ones that we could influence. The top factor by far was the disatisfaction of swim lesson quality. We looked for phrases like "Not enough progress" and "not advancing/learning"

## 2. Data Analysis:

### Step 3: Identified a significant number of withdrawals due to perceived lack of progress.
### Step 4: Discovered that most parents of these students were unaware of the reasons for their child's lack of progress.

## 3. Strategy Development:

### Step 5: Created a multistep intervention plan.
### Step 6: Identified students who were at risk of withdrawal, specifically those falling behind after the average progression period but before parents typically withdrew their children.

## 4. Implementation:

### Step 7: Categorized identified students for targeted interventions, including:
  - Monthly parent communication
  - Monthly evaluations by a supervisor
  - Monthly one-on-one help for the student
  
## 5. Presentation and Approval:

### Step 8: Presented the intervention plan to stakeholders using data visualization tools such as Tableau.
## 6. Monitoring and Evaluation:

### Step 9: After approval, monitored key performance indicators (KPIs) including enrollment reduction and parent satisfaction.
### Step 10: Achieved a 50% reduction in withdrawals related to lack of progress year-over-year (YoY).
