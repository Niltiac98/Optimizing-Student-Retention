# Optimizing Student Retention
This project analyzes anonymized swim school data to identify the optimal timing for additional student support and parent communication. By implementing these strategies, the school achieved a 50% year-over-year reduction in withdrawals due to perceived lack of progress, highlighting significant improvements in retention and satisfaction.

## 1. Problem Identification:

### Step 1: Analyzed the reasons for student withdrawals.

Withdrawal forms included a space for parents to state their reasons for withdrawal and a scale of 1-10 for rating our facility.

### Step 2: Focused on factors that could be influenced by the swim school.

We concentrated on factors within our control. The primary factor identified was dissatisfaction with the quality of swim lessons, evidenced by phrases such as "Not enough progress" and "not advancing/learning."

## 2. Data Analysis:

### Step 3: Identified a significant number of withdrawals due to perceived lack of progress.

The leading cause of withdrawals was dissatisfaction with swim lesson quality. Common phrases included:

"Not enough progress"
"Not advancing/learning"

Other lesser factors included price, lesson length, anxiety, etc.

### Step 4: Discovered that most parents of these students were unaware of the reasons for their child's lack of progress.

Discussions with withdrawing parents revealed that communication and improvement speed were significant factors in their decision. Many parents agreed to continue after we offered one-on-one sessions to address their concerns.

## 3. Strategy Development:

### Step 5: Created a multistep intervention plan.

I led a team of supervisors to develop a plan to enhance progress and communication. We decided that monthly:

Students would be evaluated by a supervisor.
An extra instructor would provide one-on-one attention in class.
Supervisors would communicate with parents about their child's progress.

### Step 6: Identified students who were at risk of withdrawal, specifically those falling behind after the average progression period but before parents typically withdrew their children.

We determined that students who had been enrolled for 4-6 months were at higher risk of withdrawal.

## 4. Implementation:

### Step 7: Scheduled identified students for targeted interventions

We assigned a manager to pull monthly data on at-risk students. Supervisors used a task list to document completed processes with students and parents.
  
## 5. Presentation and Approval:

### Step 8: Presented the intervention plan to stakeholders using data tools like Excel and Tableau.

After one month of data collection, I presented our findings to the location owner and general manager. The plan was approved for regular implementation.

### Step 9: After approval, monitored key performance indicators (KPIs) including enrollment reduction and parent satisfaction.

We tracked the following KPIs to measure the program's success:

  - Enrollment Count
  - Parent Satisfaction
  - Withdrawal Reasons

Additional metrics tracked included:

  - Employee/Student Ratio (identifying if certain instructors were slower at advancing students)
  - Supervisor task completion rate
  - Supervisor team success rate by day of the week

### Step 10: Achieved a 50% reduction in withdrawals related to lack of progress year-over-year (YoY).

One year after implementation, we reassessed the program's impact. Accounting for enrollment variations, we found a 50% reduction in withdrawals due to lack of progress.
